Flavescence dorée is a non-curable disease of the grapevine spread all over the world. In the white varieties the leaves take on a yellowish color, while in the red varieties the color changes to reddish. The leaves then roll down from the edge and take on a triangular shape. The sprout remains green and does not turn into wood, the berries die. The first suspected case in South Tyrol was registered in 2016; since then the number of infestations has been steadily increasing and the disease of the vines is spreading from south to north. The pathogen of flavescence dorée is the cell-wall-free bacterium Flavescence dorèe-Phytoplasma (FDp). The main vector is the American vine leafhopper, a variety of vine cicada introduced in Europe about seventy years ago that spends its entire life cycle on the vine, transmitting the disease from branch to branch and from vineyard to vineyard, thus causing the occurrence of real epidemic outbreaks.
