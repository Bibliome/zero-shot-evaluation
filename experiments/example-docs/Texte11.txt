Xylella, the use of biosensors allows to find the bacterium before it acts - Dissapore
A group of researchers is using electronic biosensors to find the Xylella bacterium before its effects are visible.
The use of electronic biosensors could help detect a single Xylella bacterium quickly, even earlier that it acts and that its effects actually become visible, in such a way as to allow much more effective contrast interventions: this, in a nutshell, is the objective of the research of the Institute for the Sustainable Protection of Plants (Cnr-Ipsp) and the Institute of Photonics and Nanotechnology (Cnr-Ifn) of the National Research Council, in collaboration with the Departments of Chemistry, Pharmacy-Drug Sciences and Physics of the University of Bari, with the contribution of Agritest.
As the scientists themselves explain, in fact, the ultrasensitive detection of Xylella has so far made use of molecular detection tests that point to the DNA of the bacterium itself as a target: the use of this type of analysis, however, necessarily involves the use of laboratory equipment and infrastructure together with analysis times of at least three hours. "The innovative electronic platform proposed by the team of researchers from Bari would instead allow the detection of a single bacterium in just 30 minutes directly in the field" explains Luisa Torsi, full professor of analytical chemistry at the University of Bari and vice president of the Scientific Council of the Cnr, which coordinated the research.
In other words, identifying the bacterium early and then implementing the appropriate containment measures seems to represent a concrete method for slowing down its progress. “We need rapid and reliable tools to diagnose and intervene early trying to stop the disease, for which no cures capable of healing infected plants have so far been found”.” explained in this regard Donato Boscia, head of the Bari office of the Institute for the Sustainable Protection of Plants (Cnr-Ipsp). At the same time, we remind you that 22 million euros were allocated this summer for the replanting of olive trees in the infected area.
