For apple proliferation, psyllids seem to be responsible for the transmission of the disease, even though leafhoppers also have been reported as possible vectors. Hegab and El-Zohairy (1986) described the ability of a spittlebug, Philaenus spumarius (L.) (Homoptera: Cercopidae) and a leafhopper, Artianus interstitialis (Germar) (Homoptera: Cicadellidae), in transmitting apple proliferation from infected celery to apple seedlings and from infected to healthy celery. Another leafhopper, Fieberiella florii St√•l (Homoptera: Cicadellidae), has been implicated in unconfirmed reports as a vector of AP in Germany (Krczal et al. 1988).
