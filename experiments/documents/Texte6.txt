Golden flavescence in the vineyards, the first case in the Burgraviato
The yellow lights continue to spread. The Bassa Atesina is particularly affected: in Salorno almost all the controlled areas have symptomatic vines; in one vineyard the percentage of diseased plants has even reached 19 percent - the whole vineyard must be eradicated from 20 percent. And, for the first time, a case of flavescence dor√©e was also detected in the Burgraviato.
