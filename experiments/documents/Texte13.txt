"The Fall Armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda), a notorious plant pest, has been found on maize crops in Kenya. This pest is known to cause maize lethal necrosis, a serious disease affecting maize plants. Additionally, the pest is vected by the corn leafhopper (Dalbulus maidis), an insect vector commonly found in South America."

Geographic ranges of species in this assemblage extend as far west as Britain and Western Europe, as shown by Cacopsylla pyrisuga (Foerster), C. pyri, and C. pyricola; eastwards into Uzbekistan, Turkey, and neighboring regions [Cacopsylla fera (Baeva) and Cacopsylla bidens (Šulc)]; and southwards into the Mediterranean Basin and Middle East, as shown again by C. bidens (Burckhardt and Hodkinson 1986, Cho et al. 2017, Akbar et al 2018; see also Fig. 2). Descriptions and identification keys are available in Burckhardt and Hodkinson (1986). Most species in this group associate with the European pear (P. communis), although other Pyrus also are hosts, such as Pyrus spinosa Forsskål for Cacopsylla notata (Flor) and the wild pear Pryus korshinskyi Litvinov hosting C. fera (Burckhardt and Hodkinson 1986, Cho et al. 2017).
