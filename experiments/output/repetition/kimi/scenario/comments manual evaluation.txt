**Texte10**

Syntax : 
unchanged among runs
do not follow the relation argument syntax
{
      "type": "relation label",
      "arguments": {
        "entity type": "entity value",
        "entity type": "entity value"
      }
instead:
"source": "entity value", "type": "relation label", "target": "entity value"
     
      
Schema constraints : do not respect relation argument types
Change the label of types in relations
Example : "source": "potato aphid", "type": "Have been found on", "target": "strawberries"
instead of 
"type": "Located in", "arguments": {"pest": "potato aphid", "geographical location": "UK"}}


- Content variation
repetition of entities
more or less organization entities as locations
presence of "plant disease" and "crop losses" vary

- accuracy

false positive entities
plant diseases, crop losses too general
Organizations tagged as locations : Natural Environment Research Council, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, United Nations


false positive relations do not respect the argument type constraints : 
located in, between Midlands and UK
located in between the 3 organizations and UK (reasonable as they are locations)

plant disease affects strawberries : ok since "plant disease" is viewed as 
 
false negative : do not respect argument type but semantically relevant

potato aphid in UK
strawberries in UK
aphid affects strawberries

almost correct (format incorrect) : 
"source": "potato aphid", "type": "Have been found on", "target": "strawberries"

missing: pest in location
aphid in UK


**Texte2**

- Syntax : same syntax problem

- Content variation
no

- Accuracy
perfect



**Texte 5**
- Syntax
same syntax problem
one of the relation argument is not an entity: fat body cells

-Content variation
variations on the relationships about the microbes that are in the insects

- accuracy
Balclutha species tagged as location
no extraction was expected. Then all extracted information (entities and relationships) is incorrect: all false positive
Then the extractions make sense if the micrbes would be plant pest and the insect would be vectors, which they are not.

Concuclusion : not too far, appropriate instruction should correct that.
