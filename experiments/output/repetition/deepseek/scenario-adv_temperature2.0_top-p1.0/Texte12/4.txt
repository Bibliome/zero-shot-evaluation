### Explanation:
1. **Entities**:
   - "Bactrocera dorsalis" is a pest.
   - "host plant" is a plant.
   - "methyl eugenol", "γ-octalactone", "benzothiazole", "(+)-dipentene", and "ethyl tiglate" are chemicals mentioned in the text, but since "Chemical" is not one of the specified entity types (Pest, Vector, Plant, Disease, Geographic), they are not included in the relationships.

2. **Relationships**:
   - The relationship "Transmit" is only between a vector and a pest, but "Bactrocera dorsalis" is a pest, not a vector, so this relationship is not valid based on the given relationship types (source should be a vector and target a pest). Therefore, it is excluded in the final output.

Note: Since "Chemical" is not an accepted entity type in the provided instructions, entities related to chemicals are excluded from the relationships. Assuming the core focus is on the pest "Bactrocera dorsalis" and its relation to the plant, the relationship involving these should align with the provided relationship types, but no valid relationships were found in this context.
