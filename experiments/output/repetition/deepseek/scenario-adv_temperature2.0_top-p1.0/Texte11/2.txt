### Explanation:
- **Entities**: 
  - "Xylella" is explicitly mentioned as a bacterium and classified as a **Pest**.
  - "olive trees" are mentioned in the context of being infected, hence labeled as **Plant**.
  - "Bari" is a geographic location mentioned multiple times and classified as **Geographic**.

- **Relationships**:
  - "Xylella" (Pest) is **Located in** "Bari" (Geographic) because the research and containment efforts are described as happening in Bari.
  - "olive trees" (Plant) are also **Located in** "Bari" (Geographic) as the infected area is referenced in the context of Bari.

- **Excluded Relationships**:
  - No direct relationships like "Causes", "Affects", or "Transmit" could be extracted because the text does not explicitly state that Xylella directly causes a specific disease or affects olive trees. While it is implied, the text does not provide explicit statements for these relationships.
  - The research context is discussed, but it does not explicitly link Xylella to a disease or vector beyond general implications.
