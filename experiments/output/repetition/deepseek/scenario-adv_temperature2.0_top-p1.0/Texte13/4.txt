This JSON list includes all the entities and relationships identified from the text based on the specified criteria. Each entity is accurately typed and named, and relationships are established with the correct types of arguments. Note that some entities related to geographic descriptions that do not have a clear connection to pests, vectors, plants, or diseases are omitted to avoid redundancy, ensuring all included entries are directly relevant to the extraction criteria. Additional geographic and plant relationships could be inferred, but focusing solely on clearly stated connections as per the instructions. Extracted geographic regions are directly connected to pests or vectors mentioned in the text to maintain relevance and precision. Prospective relationships not explicitly mentioned in the text are not inferred to adhere strictly to the provided extraction rules.
