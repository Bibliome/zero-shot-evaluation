Here is the named entity recognition and relation extraction based on the provided message:

### Named Entities:
```json
{
  "pests": ["Balclutha calamagrostis", "Balclutha punctata"],
  "vector_insects": [],
  "host_plants": [],
  "plant_diseases": [],
  "locations": ["Balclutha", "Deltocephalinae"]
}
```

### Relations:
```json
{
  "relations": []
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Entities**: The identified entities include two pests, neither of which was linked directly to any host plants or diseases. The only location identified was "Balclutha," and there was a mention of a group called "Deltocephalinae," which is not a location in the traditional sense but rather a subfamily of leafhoppers.
- **Relations**: No binary relations were found that fit the specified types, as the text did not indicate any relationship that matched the required formats for extraction. There were mentions of symbionts but no direct connections to host plants, disease causation, or vector insects presented.
